# Retail Sales Performance Analysis & Predictive Insights
# ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project delivers a comprehensive retail sales analysis and prediction system by integrating multiple tools and technologies. 
The goal was to transform raw sales data into actionable business insights, forecast future trends, and create interactive decision-making platforms for stakeholders.
It covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning, and dashboard creation in a seamless workflow.

# ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
Data Preparation: Clean and preprocess sales data for accuracy.

Business Insights: Identify top-performing products, high-revenue regions, and seasonal sales patterns.

Predictive Modeling: Build machine learning models to forecast sales and classify customers.

Interactive Visualization: Develop dashboards and applications to enable real-time business decisions.

# Tools & Technologies
SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL) â†’ Data loading, cleaning, preprocessing, and initial EDA.

Excel â†’ Pivot tables, quick KPI reporting, and summary analysis.

Python â†’ EDA, feature engineering, ML model building, and data visualization.

Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Streamlit â†’ Deploy machine learning models as interactive web applications.

Power BI â†’ Executive-level dashboards for performance monitoring and insights.

# ðŸ“‚ Workflow
Phase 1 - SQL

Load raw CSV data into SQL database.

Clean data (handle missing values, remove duplicates, convert data types).

Conduct initial EDA to explore sales trends, product categories, and customer segments.

Phase 2 - Excel

Connect Excel to SQL for live data access.

Generate pivot reports for category contribution, growth rate, and regional performance.

Phase 3 - Python (Machine Learning)

Load cleaned SQL data into Python.

Perform advanced EDA and data visualization.

# Build:

Regression models for sales forecasting.

Classification models for customer purchase prediction.

Save trained models for deployment.

Phase 4 - Streamlit

Develop an interactive app where users can enter parameters and get sales predictions.

Display EDA charts dynamically for better decision-making.

Phase 5 - Power BI

Connect SQL database directly to Power BI.

Create dashboards with KPIs, filters, and interactive visuals for management review.

# ðŸ“Š Key Insights
Top Product Line: XYZ Products generated 28% of total sales.
